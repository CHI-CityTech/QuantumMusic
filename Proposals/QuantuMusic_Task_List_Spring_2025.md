## 🧩 1. Quantum Computing Collaborative AI & Studio Display Wall Presentation

**Goal**: Build and maintain a modular visual installation for the CHI Studio’s Collaborative AI wall, representing the Quantum Music project in process.  
**Estimated Time**: 4–5 hours

[Detailed Assignment](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/Proposals/QuantumWallDisplay.md)

- Coordinate with CHI to understand space and mounting needs for the display wall
- Collect existing materials for the display from the shared resources folder:
  - Intro poster text and flow diagram (music → data → quantum → regeneration)
  - Musical parameters table (especially those used in the microstudy)
  - Key equations with annotated descriptions
  - Page of a Mozart score (first movement exposition of Sonatas 1–3)
  - Data structure table (Time, Pitch, Duration) and piano roll
  - MIDI parsing Python snippet and output
  - Simple quantum circuit preview from Qiskit or sketch
  - Research QR code links (GitHub, Zotero, Listening Examples)
- Design and prepare individual poster panels or cards using Canva, Slides, or exportable formats
- Draft wall copy (labels and captions) and a clear statement of the wall as “work-in-progress”
- Assist with physical mounting or visualization logistics in the CHI studio

## 📚 2. Zotero Collation and Organization

**Goal**: Make Zotero a fully functional research hub for the project.  
**Estimated Time**: 5–6 hours

- Upload additional documents not yet entered into Zotero
- Ensure all items have:
  - Abstracts (summaries of key points)
  - Tags (keywords, e.g., “quantum”, “Mozart”, “AI”, “algorithmic music”)
  - Relevancy notes or annotations
- Organize all materials into existing or new subcollections
- Create a shared “Precedent Research Summary” note inside Zotero (linked from collection root)

## 🧠 3. Precedent Research Expansion

**Goal**: Fill in gaps in literature review related to quantum music, AI-assisted composition, and algorithmic generation.  
**Estimated Time**: 4–5 hours

- Identify at least 3–5 additional research sources beyond current Zotero collection, focusing on:
  - Quantum computing and generative music
  - Algorithmic composition (e.g., Hiller, Xenakis, GANs)
  - Symbolic music data analysis
- Draft a 1-page summary of “State of the Field” with citations
- Suggest how these sources relate to the microstudy equations or musical parameters list

## 🎼 4. Musical Data Extraction

**Goal**: Prepare musical material in a form suitable for quantum processing.  
**Estimated Time**: 2–3 hours

- Use the **exposition sections** from the **first movements** of **Mozart Piano Sonatas 1, 2, and 3** to ensure alignment with standard **Sonata-Allegro form**
- Export their full MIDI files from source
- Use MIDI tools to **split each exposition section into musical phrases**
- Re-import **each phrase as a separate MIDI file**
- Ensure reimported phrases are formatted for compatibility with the Qiskit process

---

## 🔍 5. Data Processing Research

**Goal**: Explore and document technical options for parsing and transforming MIDI files.  
**Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours

- Review libraries like `music21` and `mido` for capabilities in:
  - Phrase segmentation
  - Beat-aligned timestamps
  - Pattern analysis or motif identification
- Write a short guide or annotated code snippets for:
  - Extracting phrases
  - Tagging phrase boundaries
  - Mapping notes to parameter values (pitch, duration, time)

---

## 🐍 6. Python Coding Foundations

**Goal**: Build technical confidence and practical tools in the Python environment.  
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

- Follow 1–2 beginner tutorials for music21 or mido
- Write test scripts to:
  - Load MIDI files
  - Extract pitch/duration/time triplets
  - Output to CSV or array format
- Begin notebook documenting “Quantum Music Data Toolkit”
