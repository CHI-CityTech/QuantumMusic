# Quantum Music Wall Display Proposal  
**CHI Studio – Collaborative AI Display Area**  

**Project Lead**: David B. Smith  
**Research Assistant**: Elizabeth Frias  
**Host**: Center for Holistic Integration (CHI)  

**Anticipated Hours**: ~13 hours (tentative)

---

## Project Purpose

The **Quantum Music Wall Display** is a live, evolving research showcase within the **Collaborative AI display area** of the **CHI Studio (Center for Holistic Integration)**. It presents the speculative and experimental process of transforming classical musical material into data structures for quantum interpretation, while highlighting the role of artificial intelligence as an active collaborator in the creative process.

This display embodies the CHI ethos of interdisciplinary exploration, system integration, and holistic research methodology.

## Objectives

- Visually communicate the **music-to-quantum pipeline**.
- Demonstrate symbolic transformation of classical music using both visual score and machine-readable data.
- Contextualize the **role of collaborative AI** in probabilistic generation and interpretation.
- Reinforce CHI’s mission through a modular, evolving research installation.

## Implementation Note

> **Most of the visual and textual material already exists.**  
> This is primarily a task of **collection, collation, formatting, printing, and mounting** existing assets.  
> A shared folder of resources (documents, images, code snippets, MIDI files) will be provided to streamline the process.

## Core Visual Components

### 1. Intro Panel: Quantum Music & Collaborative AI
- Project title and mission statement.
- Visual flow from music → data → quantum model → regenerated music.
- Framing paragraph on AI as collaborator, not tool.
- **Sample caption**: _"This project explores how musical ideas become quantum data—and how AI becomes a partner in composition."_

### 2. Musical Parameters Poster
- Grid of musical parameters with clear grouping.
- Highlight the three used in the microstudy: **Pitch**, **Duration**, **Time**.
- Tag others as "future inputs."
- **Sample caption**: _"These musical parameters define how a melody becomes measurable and computational."_

### 3. Equation Panel
- Key 3D trajectory equations from the model.
- Simplified annotation for each variable.
- Optional: sketched diagram of a music trajectory in 3D space.
- **Sample caption**: _"These equations describe how music can move through a mathematical space, allowing for probabilistic recomposition."_

### 4. From Mozart to Data (Score Panel)
- Print excerpt of a Mozart sonata (e.g., K.331).
- Data list: `Time, Pitch, Duration`.
- Piano roll visualization of same passage.
- Caption explaining how notation becomes structure.
- **Sample caption**: _"A single musical phrase, shown as notation, structured data, and visual rhythm."_

### 5. Code Snippet Poster
- Python MIDI parsing snippet (e.g., using `mido` or `music21`).
- Sample output of symbolic data.
- **Sample caption**: _"Python code helps us transform a piano performance into digital structure."_

### 6. Quantum Circuit Preview
- Simplified Qiskit circuit for encoding note states.
- Short text on quantum encoding design goals.
- **Sample caption**: _"What would it mean for a melody to become a quantum state? This is where we begin."_

### 7. Work-in-Progress Label
> _“This wall is a living lab. These posters reflect ongoing research and design. Expect updates, iterations, and provocations.”_

### 8. Contributor Acknowledgements (Optional)
- Name cards or short bios for student participants and collaborators.

### 9. History and Genesis Document
- Authored by Elizabeth Frias
- Traces the origins of the Quantum Music project before current leadership
- **Sample caption**: _"This project began before we joined it—here is the story of how it started."_

### 10. Original Poster Artifact
- Reprint of the original concept image or sketch
- Mounted with caption:
- **Sample caption**: _"The spark: This image set the first ideas in motion for what became the Quantum Music project."_

## Notes

This display is designed as a **modular, iterative research visualization**. It does not need to be fully complete at any given moment—it simply needs to **communicate progress**. Each panel is an invitation to curiosity, insight, and conversation.

The wall is also a **physical space for Collaborative AI to speak**, with contributions from students, researchers, and intelligent systems displayed together.
