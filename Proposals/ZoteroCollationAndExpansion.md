# Zotero Collation and Research Expansion Project
**Quantum Music Research – Precedent Studies and Organization**

**Research Assistant**: Elizabeth Frias  
**Project Lead**: David B. Smith  
**Affiliation**: CHI Studio – Quantum Music Group  

**Estimated Time Commitment**: ~12–14 hours (tentative)  
**Zotero Library**: [https://www.zotero.org/groups/5772697/quantum_ai_music](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5772697/quantum_ai_music)

## Project Purpose

This project supports the broader Quantum Music initiative by ensuring the **Zotero research library** is a well-organized, annotated, and expandable foundation for all precedent studies, theoretical frameworks, and technical references. Elizabeth will serve as lead curator and organizer, maintaining research hygiene, contributing annotations, and expanding the corpus with additional relevant materials.

---

## Objectives

- Upload and organize existing materials collected by the team
- Annotate each item with abstract summaries, relevance tags, and classification
- Ensure all items are correctly grouped within subcollections by theme or topic
- Add 3–5 new sources related to quantum computing and music generation
- Draft a summary page of key findings and themes from the literature

## Notes

This collation project will feed into other areas including:
- The Collaborative AI wall display (source quotes, diagrams, and background texts)
- The Quantum Music GitHub documentation
- Public presentation and publishing efforts in Summer/Fall

Additional tagging standards and folder naming conventions will be reviewed with the team as needed.
