3. **Join the Shared Group Library:**  
   - Join our Zotero group: [Quantum AI Music Repository](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5772697/quantum_ai_music).
4. **Add an Initial Source:**  
   - Find a relevant paper (e.g., on quantum computing in music) and add it to the library.  Make sure to apply proper tags and citation information.

#### **1.3 Discord (Team Communication)**
ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:** Discord will be used for informal communication, quick discussions, and team coordination.

ðŸ”¹ **Action Steps:**
1. **Join the Server:**
   - Many of you may already be a member, but if so please still perform the rest.

### **3. Familiarize Yourself with Key Research Areas (Ongoing)**
ðŸ“Œ **Purpose:** This is an **ongoing** research phase. You should become familiar with foundational concepts, but additional research tasks will be assigned later.

ðŸ”¹ **Action Steps:**
1. **Review the following materials at your own pace:**  
   - Introduction to **Quantum Computing**: [Resource Link]  
   - Overview of **Musical Syntax & Structure**: [Resource Link]  
   - Introduction to **Symbolic Music Data (MIDI, MusicXML)**: [Resource Link]
2. **Keep Notes for Future Discussions:**  
   - Identify key takeaways and areas where you need clarification.
   - Bring questions to our meetings or post them in Discord.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This is **not part of the first assigned tasks** but is meant to help you prepare for deeper research later.
