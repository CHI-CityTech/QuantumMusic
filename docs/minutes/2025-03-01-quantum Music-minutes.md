- **Sunima** to research **IBM Quantum coding practices** and determine what languages and approaches are useful,.  
- **Sunima** to research **how to convert MIDI files** into a simple data structure compatible with quantum computing.  
- **All team members** to review **basic musical structures and parameters** using David's documents as a starting point.  
- **All team members** to explore **IBM Quantum** and its basic materials.  
- **David** to contact **Professor Berman** for basic formulas and discuss parameters for the project.
- **David** to generate a "simplest pipeline" to test system design and identify issues with design or implementation.  
- **David** to create and send out a **Doodle poll** for finding a more permanent meeting time.  
- **All team members** to add relevant **research materials** to the Zotero library.  
- **All team members** to create **task cards in GitHub** for their assigned research areas.  
- **Next Meeting:** **Tuesday at 7 PM**

## Summary  

### Zoom Backgrounds and Project Management Approach  
- David suggested that, if at all possible, Zoom sessions adopt a "camnera on" policy.
- David explained **how to set a fun background** in Zoom and demonstrated the process.
  - User, settings, backgrounds, select filter
  - [Zoom set background documentation](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060387)     
- The team discussed **finding a better meeting time** than Friday evening.  
- David introduced **Kanban boards** for task organization into "To Do" and "In Progress" lists.  
- Emphasized a **simple, small-scale approach** to test concepts before expansion.  
- The first week will focus on **research tasks** and **understanding project concepts**, including quantum mechanics.  

### IBM ID Registration and Task Management  
- David guided the team on **registering for an IBM ID**.  
- Explained how to **assign tasks and report progress** on a project management platform.  
- The platform will help **reduce bookkeeping time** and **link work to the repository**.  
- Elizabeth noted that **Professor Berman** will **join the next meeting**.  
- Team members were encouraged to **track tasks and report progress** via the platform.  

### Understanding Music Composition Parameters  
- Discussion on **music composition** and its defining **parameters**:  
  - Pitch    
  - Time     
  - Hierarchical structures  
- Need for a **comprehensive list of musical parameters** for consistency in software programming.
  - An important activity is identifying which parameters will be used.
  - Some parameters are "primitive" (pitch, time, loudness), while others may be Aable to be   

### Enhancing Project Organization and Roles  
- This research project will be managed via the QuantumMusic [**Project Board**](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/projects/43).  
- Discussion on **team roles and task distribution**.  
- Elizabeth emphasized **matching team members to suitable roles**.  
- **Task card system** introduced for **organizing tasks**.  
- Need for software for **data entry** and **schedule management**.  
- Elizabeth offered to coordinate **Discord for communication** and suggested adding Sunima.  
- The team agreed to **update Professor Berman** through **meeting minutes**.  

### Data Collection and Research Planning  
- David emphasized the need for **data collection and testing**, even if **initial results are not meaningful**.  
- Each team member will **create an issue card** outlining their assignment for the week.
- Elizabeth volunteered for **data coordination and research**.  
- Sunima confirmed she **obtained an IBM ID**.  
- The team agreed to **focus on small tests** to determine the best tools.  

### Task Management and Quantum Testing  
- The team discussed informal **task discussions** via a group chat.  
- Meetings will be kept **short and focused** with an agenda.  
- David demonstrated access to the [**team's landing page**](https://github.com/orgs/CHI-CityTech/teams/quantummusic).    
- Davidâ€™s next task: **designing a minimal test pilot** for the system.  
  - **Acquiring musical data**  
  - **Converting data into a qubit-compatible format**  
  - **Testing with minimal parameters**  
  - **Processing data on a quantum computer**  
  - **Converting output into machine-readable music**  

### Project Tools and Task Management  
- Tools discussed:  
  - **GitHub** for version control  
  - **Zotero** for research organization  
  - **Discord** for team communication  
- **Organizing research tasks** with labels and structured folders.  
- **Google Docs** can be used for collaborative research before finalizing in GitHub.  
- Initial activities:  
  - **Literature review on quantum computing**  
  - **Algorithmic composition research** approaches and techniques.
