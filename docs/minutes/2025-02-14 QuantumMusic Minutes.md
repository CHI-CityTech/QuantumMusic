## **Summary of Discussions**

### **1. Exploring Creativity and Mathematical Connections**
- **Mozartâ€™s composition process** was discussed in terms of **probabilistic decision-making**.
- **David compared** this approach to **abstract mathematics** and how musical structures can be analyzed dimensionally.
- **Oleg shared** his method of approaching **physics problems** by considering different possible outcomes.
- **Reference to Pythagoras**, who **linked musical notes to mathematical ratios**, underscoring the deep connection between music and mathematics.

---

### **2. Quantum Computing for Musical Compositions**
- Discussed the potential use of **quantum computing** to create new compositions inspired by **Mozart and Wagner**.
- **Oleg proposed** analyzing Mozartâ€™s works to extract **probability distributions** for different musical elements.
- **David suggested** real-time control over the composition, blending multiple styles.
- Explored the idea of using **quantum models to create a new "composer"** that fuses different stylistic elements.

---

### **3. Quantum Computing and Music Creation**
- **Concern over quantum simulation:**  
  - Simulating quantum operations with classical computing is **not truly quantum**.
- **Comparing music to physics:**  
  - David compared the **Heisenberg uncertainty principle** to the way musical elements (pitch, rhythm, articulation) interact.
- **Dataset considerations:**  
  - Larger datasets yield **more precise results** when generating music via quantum algorithms.
- **Input Data Possibilities:**  
  - **MIDI files**
  - **Paper scores**
  - **Audio recordings**

---

### **4. Digital Notation System Development**
- **David proposed** defining a digital notation system based on **hierarchical rules**.
- **Plan:** Start with a **2D representation**, then expand to more complex **dimensional mappings**.
- **Setup:**  
  - A **GitHub repository** for the project (*Quantum Music*).  
  - All students must **create GitHub accounts** and **send usernames** to David.  
  - **Google Doc shared** with instructions for project setup.

---

### **5. Quantum Computing Research and Tools**
- **Scholarly Research Practices:**  
  - **Zotero** will be used for documentation and citations.
- **Programming for Quantum Computing:**  
  - Understanding quantum-specific languages (e.g., **Q#**).
- **Student Assignments:**  
  - Submit a **summary of academic background**, **technical skills**, and **aspirations**.
  - **Initial research tasks:**
    - Review **quantum computing basics**.
