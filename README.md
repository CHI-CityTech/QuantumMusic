### 2025-02-20 Assignments

[Startup tasks can be found at this document](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/startup_tasks.md): please read it and perform the assignments within.  **Pay particular attention to [section 2](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/startup_tasks.md#2-submit-your-background--aspirations).**

It is now time to move to initial assignments, and completing the onboading process.

### 2025-02-14
First assignments are to create a GitHub account which you can do [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)

Current Documentation for this project is listed below.  

[Spring 2025 Research Proposal](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/Proposals/Quantum_Music_Proposal_Spring_2025.md)  
A more targeted proposal to encompass activity in Spring 2025.

[Initial Proposal](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/Proposals/InitialProposal.md)  
Outlines the proposal and provides some organizing principles and discussion.  This is a draft document.  

[Potential Musical Parameters](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/docs/music/Potential-Musical-Parameters.md)
Lists potential musical parameters.  Note that some of these are "secondary":  parameters that are calculated from the data set's primary patterns: such as pitch, time, instrument, loudness, etc.  Note that this list will most likely be culled, since at the moment not sure if these underlying secondary relationships may already be embedded in the primary data set.  However, we will want to be able to parametricize these secondary in order to provide some steering of musical generation or interpolation.

[Musical Parameters: Details](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/QuantumMusic/blob/main/docs/music/musicalParameterDetails.md)  
A Detailed discussion about each parameter with potential formulae or computational approaches for each.
