#### **2. Registration**

# Comprehensive Musical Parameters
## **Notation**
We adopt the following symbols for musical parameters, derived from musical set theory, harmonic analysis, and time-based analysis:

- $p$: **Pitch**, represented as a numeric value where each octave increment is 12 (e.g., $p = 0, 1, \dots, 11$ for one octave).
- $pc$: **Pitch class**, derived by modulo operation to strip octave information:  $pc \equiv p \pmod{12}$
- $r$: **Registration**, representing the octave of a pitch:  $r = \lfloor p / 12 \rfloor$
- $f_1$: **Fundamental frequency**, the base frequency of a harmonic series, corresponding to $h = 1$ (e.g., $f_1 = 440 \, \text{Hz}$ for A4).
- $h$: **Harmonic number**, an integer identifying the position of a partial in the harmonic series, where:  $h = 1$ is the fundamental, $h = 2$ is the second harmonic (octave), and so on.
- $f_h$: **Harmonic partial frequency**, the frequency of the $h$-th harmonic partial:  
  $f_h = h \times f_1$
- $r_{p_1, p_2}$: **Frequency ratio** between two pitches $p_1$ and $p_2$:  
  $r_{p_1, p_2} = \frac{f(p_1)}{f(p_2)}$
- $S$: **Melodic series**, the ordered sequence of note events:  
  $S = \{n_1, n_2, n_3, \dots, n_k\}$
- $n_i$: **Note event**, the $i$-th element in the melodic series $S$, representing a single note event.
- $t_i$: **Time**, the timestamp of the $i$-th note event in $S$, measured in beats or seconds.



### **Series-Based Representation**

The melodic line can now be expressed as an ordered tuple or set:
$\[
S = \{(p_1, t_1), (p_2, t_2), (p_3, t_3), \dots, (p_k, t_k)\}
\]$
where each element $(p_i, t_i)$ represents the pitch and time of the $i$-th note event.

- **Pitch Series**: $\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k\}$
- **Time Series**: $\{t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k\}$

For example, if we have a melodic sequence of four notes (in this case $C4, D4, E4, G4$):
- Pitches: $\{60, 62, 64, 67\}$
- Times: $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ (measured in beats),
The melodic series is:
\[
S = \{(60, 0), (62, 1), (64, 2), (67, 3)\}
\]

## **1. Pitch Class**

**Definition:**  
The *Pitch Class* ($pc$) represents the pitch identity of a note without octave information, encoded as integers from $0$ to $11$. Each pitch class corresponds to one of the 12 semitones in an octave:
- $0 = C$, $1 = C\sharp/D\flat$, $2 = D$, $\dots$, $11 = B$.

**Formula:**  
The pitch class is derived using the modulo operation:

$$
pc \equiv p \pmod{12}
$$

**Explanation:**  
- The modulo operation removes octave information, leaving only the pitch within a single octave.
- For example:
  - If $p = 60$ ($C\sharp$), $pc = 60 \pmod{12} = 0$ ($C$).
  - If $p = 61$ ($C\sharp4$), $pc = 61 \pmod{12} = 1$ ($C\sharp$).
  - If $p = 73$ ($C\sharp5$), $pc = 73 \pmod{12} = 1$ ($C\sharp$).

**Musical Context:**  
The concept of pitch class allows for the human perception that a pitch and its octave equivalents share a fundamental commonality. This abstraction simplifies music theory by focusing on pitch identity without considering octave placement. It is central to:
- Analyzing scales and modes.
- Identifying chord qualities and relationships.
- Grouping notes with equivalent pitch identities (e.g., enharmonic equivalents like G$\sharp$ and A$\flat$).

---

## **2. Registration**

**Definition:**  
The *Registration* ($r$) represents the octave placement of a pitch, expressed as an integer. It specifies the vertical position of a pitch on the keyboard or within a musical range.

**Formula:**  
The registration is calculated by dividing the pitch value ($p$) by 12 and taking the floor of the result:

$$
r = \lfloor p / 12 \rfloor
$$

**Explanation:**  
- Each octave spans 12 semitones. Dividing the pitch value by 12 determines its octave, while the floor operation removes any fractional part.
- For example:
  - $p = 60$ (C4): $r = \lfloor 60 / 12 \rfloor = 5$ (5th octave).
  - $p = 72$ (C5): $r = \lfloor 72 / 12 \rfloor = 6$ (6th octave).
  - $p = 59$ (B3): $r = \lfloor 59 / 12 \rfloor = 4$ (4th octave).

**Musical Context:**  
Registration provides a way to distinguish between pitches of the same pitch class across different octaves. While pitch class captures the tonal identity, registration determines the pitchâ€™s height, influencing:
- **Timbre:** High notes often sound brighter, while low notes sound darker.
- **Range:** Helps analyze a melody's tessitura (average pitch level) and range.
- **Orchestration:** Determines how instruments with overlapping ranges can interact.
- **Perception of Octave Equivalence:** Registration complements pitch class by showing how octave-related pitches differ in vertical space.

## **3. Frequency Ratio Between Notes** (Interval/Harmony)

**Definition:**  
The *Frequency Ratio Between Notes* ($r_{p_1, p_2}$) describes the relationship between two pitches, $p_1$ and $p_2$, expressed as a ratio relative to their frequencies. This approach avoids relying on specific frequency values and instead focuses on their proportional relationship.

**Formula:**  

$$
r_{p_1, p_2} = \frac{f(p_1)}{f(p_2)}
$$

**Explanation:**  
- $f(p_1)$ and $f(p_2)$ are the frequencies of two pitches, derived relative to a reference fundamental or system.
- The ratio indicates the interval between the pitches:
  - Ratios greater than 1 mean $p_1$ is higher than $p_2$.
  - Ratios less than 1 mean $p_1$ is lower than $p_2$.
  - A ratio of 1 means the two pitches are equivalent (unison).

**Generalized Interpretation:**  
- No explicit frequency calculations are needed if the system is normalized. For example:
  - If pitch $p_1$ is one octave above pitch $p_2$, $r_{p_1, p_2} = 2$ regardless of their absolute frequencies.
  - If pitch $p_1$ is a perfect fifth above $p_2$, $r_{p_1, p_2} \approx 1.5$.

**Examples (using relative ratios):**
- If $p_1$ is one octave above $p_2$:  
  $$r_{p_1, p_2} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \quad \text{(octave)}.$$
- If $p_1$ is a perfect fifth above $p_2$:  
  $$r_{p_1, p_2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \quad \text{(perfect fifth)}.$$
- If $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the same pitch:  
  $$r_{p_1, p_2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \quad \text{(unison)}.$$

**Musical Context:**  
Frequency ratios provide a universal framework for understanding intervals and tonal relationships:
- **Harmonic Intervals:** Ratios map directly to intervals, independent of tuning system or absolute pitch.
- **Generalization Across Scales:** A normalized system allows consistent comparison across musical systems, such as Western equal temperament or non-Western tuning.
- **Abstract Representation:** Ratios facilitate abstract harmonic analysis, crucial for computational models and cross-cultural music studies.

## **4. Interval Contour** (Melody)

**Definition:**  
The *Interval Contour* represents the pattern of pitch movement in a sequence, abstracting the directional relationships between consecutive intervals rather than their specific sizes. It provides a symbolic representation of whether a note ascends, descends, or remains the same relative to the previous note.

**Formula:**  
Interval contour is derived as a series of directional indicators based on the intervallic movement between consecutive pitches:  

$$
\text{Contour}\_{i} =
\begin{cases} 
+1, & \text{if } p_{i} > p_{i-1} \, \text{(ascending)} \\
0, & \text{if } p_{i} = p_{i-1} \, \text{(unchanged)} \\
-1, & \text{if } p_{i} < p_{i-1} \, \text{(descending)}
\end{cases}
$$

**Explanation:**  
- $p_{i}$ and $p_{i-1}$ are consecutive pitches in the sequence.
- The resulting sequence of $+1$, $0$, and $-1$ captures the overall shape of the melody or harmonic line without specifying interval sizes.

**Examples:**
1. For the pitch sequence $\{60, 62, 64, 64, 61\}$:
   - $\text{Intervals: } +2, +2, 0, -3$
   - $\text{Contour: } \{+1, +1, 0, -1\}$ (ascending, ascending, unchanged, descending).
2. For the pitch sequence $\{72, 70, 69, 69, 71\}$:
   - $\text{Intervals: } -2, -1, 0, +2$
   - $\text{Contour: } \{-1, -1, 0, +1\}$ (descending, descending, unchanged, ascending).

**Musical Context:**  
Interval contour abstracts the shape of a melody or harmonic movement:
- **Melodic Analysis:** Captures the directional flow of melodies, useful for identifying thematic patterns or gestures.
- **Motivic Development:** Helps compare variations of a theme across different sections of a piece.
- **Cross-Cultural Studies:** Provides a universal representation of melodic motion, independent of specific tuning or tonal systems.
- **Computational Analysis:** Facilitates machine learning models to classify and analyze melodies by reducing pitch data to simpler directional patterns.

## **3. Intervallic Movement**

**Type:** Secondary  
**Derived From:**  
- Primary Parameters: Pitch ($p$), Time ($t$).
- Aggregate, ordered series of pitches based on their time stamp ($t$)

**Definition:**  
The *Intervallic Movement* describes the pitch changes between consecutive note events in a sequence, based on their timestamps. It encompasses both the direction and magnitude of these changes, making it applicable to single melodic lines (commonly referred to as "Melodic Contour") and to aggregate relationships across polyphonic or multi-instrumental contexts.

**Formula:**  
Intervallic Movement is calculated as the difference between the pitches of consecutive note events, ordered by their timestamps:

$$
\text{Intervallic Movement}\_{i} = p_{i} - p_{i-1}, \quad \text{where } t_{i} > t_{i-1}
$$

**Explanation:**  
- **Temporal Dependence:** The parameter relies on the timestamps ($t_i$) to establish the order of the note events.
- **Single Line (Melodic Context):**  
  For a single melodic line, this parameter captures both the interval size and direction, forming the basis of melodic contour.
- **Aggregate Context (Polyphony):**  
  When applied to multiple note events occurring simultaneously or near-simultaneously, Intervallic Movement describes the pitch relationships within an ensemble or chordal texture.

- Positive values indicate ascending motion, with the magnitude representing the size of the ascent in semitones.
- Negative values indicate descending motion, with the magnitude representing the size of the descent.
- Zero indicates no pitch movement (static interval).

**Examples (Single Line):**
1. For the pitch sequence $\{60, 62, 64, 64, 61\}$ with timestamps $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$:
   - $\text{Intervallic Movement: } \{+2, +2, 0, -3\}$.
2. For the pitch sequence $\{72, 70, 69, 69, 71\}$ with timestamps $\{0, 2, 4, 5, 6\}$:
   - $\text{Intervallic Movement: } \{-2, -1, 0, +2\}$.

**Examples (Aggregate Context):**
- For a chord progression $\{\{60, 64, 67\}, \{62, 65, 69\}\}$ (C Major to D Minor) with timestamps $\{0, 1\}$:
  - $\text{Intervallic Movement: } \{+2, +1, +2\}$ (intervals between corresponding pitches in the chords).

**Musical Context:**  
Intervallic Movement is foundational to musical analysis:
- **Melodic Analysis:** For single-line melodies, it defines the contour and structure (commonly called "Melodic Contour").
- **Harmonic and Polyphonic Analysis:** Describes relationships between voices or instrument lines, capturing aggregate interval changes over time.
- **Expressive Qualities:** Large intervals may suggest drama or intensity, while small intervals contribute to smoothness or stability.
- **Computational Applications:** Serves as a flexible parameter for analyzing and classifying melodies, harmonies, or polyphonic textures.

## **4. Pitch Range**

**Type:** Secondary  
**Derived From:**  
- Aggregate: Time-independent collection of all pitches in the analyzed passage.

**Definition:**  
The *Pitch Range* is the interval spanned by the lowest and highest pitch values in a given passage. It provides a measure of the overall tonal span of the music.

**Formula:**  
The **Pitch Range** is calculated as:

$$
\text{Pitch Range} = p_{\text{max}} - p_{\text{min}}
$$

Where:
- $p_{\text{max}}$: The highest pitch in the passage.
- $p_{\text{min}}$: The lowest pitch in the passage.

**Explanation:**  
- **Time Independence:** Unlike parameters dependent on temporal order (e.g., Intervallic Movement), Pitch Range considers only the absolute extreme values, ignoring frequency of occurrence or distribution.
- **Extremes Matter:** It highlights the outer boundaries of the pitch content, which may or may not align with the central range of activity (Tessitura).

**Examples:**
1. For the pitch sequence $\{60, 62, 64, 64, 67, 72\}$:
   - $p_{\text{max}} = 72$, $p_{\text{min}} = 60$.
   - $\text{Pitch Range: } 72 - 60 = 12$ semitones (1 octave).
2. For the pitch sequence $\{50, 55, 55, 60, 62, 62, 62\}$:
   - $p_{\text{max}} = 62$, $p_{\text{min}} = 50$.
   - $\text{Pitch Range: } 62 - 50 = 12$ semitones (1 octave).

**Musical Context:**  
Pitch Range helps in understanding the registral span of a passage:
- **Expressive Qualities:** A wide pitch range can create contrast or drama, while a narrow range may emphasize intimacy or focus.
- **Instrumental and Vocal Considerations:** Highlights the technical demands on performers by identifying the span of pitches they must navigate.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Useful in evaluating stylistic tendencies, such as comparing the narrower ranges of early music to the broader ranges in Romantic or contemporary compositions.

## **5. Tessitura**

**Type:** Secondary  
**Derived From:**  
- Primary Parameters: Pitch ($p$).  
- Aggregate: Time-independent collection of all pitches in the analyzed passage.

**Definition:**  
The *Tessitura* represents the most frequently used range of pitches in a melodic or harmonic line. It is calculated as the central range of pitches that contains at least half of all note events, providing insight into the tonal or registral "comfort zone" of the music.

**Formula:**  
Let the sorted pitch set be $P = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k\}$, where $p_i \leq p_{i+1}$, and $k$ is the total number of pitches in the passage. The **Tessitura Range** is:

$$
\text{Tessitura Range} = [p_{\text{low}}, p_{\text{high}}]
$$

Where:
- $p_{\text{low}}$: The smallest pitch such that at least $\lceil k/2 \rceil$ pitches are in the range $[p_{\text{low}}, p_{\text{high}}]$.
- $p_{\text{high}}$: The largest pitch in the same range.

To find this range:
1. Sort the pitches in $P$ by ascending order.
2. Identify all possible contiguous subsets of $P$ containing at least $\lceil k/2 \rceil$ elements.
3. Choose the subset with the smallest range $[p_{\text{low}}, p_{\text{high}}]$.

**Explanation:**  
- **Time Independence:** Tessitura aggregates pitch values without regard to their timing.
- **Pitch Aggregation:** It identifies a central subset of pitches rather than focusing on individual note events.
- Unlike the full pitch range (absolute highest to lowest), Tessitura reflects the **core activity zone** of a melodic or harmonic line.

**Examples:**
1. For the pitch sequence $\{60, 62, 64, 64, 64, 67, 72\}$:
   - Sorted pitches: $\{60, 62, 64, 64, 64, 67, 72\}$.
   - $\lceil k/2 \rceil = 4$, so at least 4 pitches must fall within the range.
   - Contiguous subsets containing 4 or more pitches:
     - $\{62, 64, 64, 64\}$ (range $[62, 64]$).
     - $\{64, 64, 64, 67\}$ (range $[64, 67]$).
   - Smallest range: $[62, 64]$.
   - $\text{Tessitura Range: } [62, 64]$.
2. For the pitch sequence $\{50, 52, 55, 55, 55, 60, 62\}$:
   - Sorted pitches: $\{50, 52, 55, 55, 55, 60, 62\}$.
   - $\lceil k/2 \rceil = 4$, so at least 4 pitches must fall within the range.
   - Contiguous subsets containing 4 or more pitches:
     - $\{55, 55, 55, 60\}$ (range $[55, 60]$).
   - $\text{Tessitura Range: } [55, 60]$.

**Musical Context:**  
Tessitura is crucial for understanding the registral tendencies of a melodic or harmonic line:
- **Vocal and Instrumental Writing:** Helps determine the comfort zone for performers, especially in vocal music, where Tessitura affects ease and timbre.
- **Expressive Qualities:** A higher Tessitura conveys brightness or tension, while a lower Tessitura suggests warmth or gravity.
- **Style and Genre:** Different musical styles favor distinct Tessituras (e.g., Baroque music may have a lower Tessitura compared to Romantic-era music).

## **6. Harmonic Root**

**Type:** Secondary  
**Derived From:**  
- Aggregate: Set of simultaneous note events (pitch values).  
- Primary Parameters: Pitch ($p$).

**Definition:**  
The *Harmonic Root* identifies the specific pitch (including registration) that serves as the implied fundamental frequency for a set of simultaneous pitches. It represents the **lowest shared harmonic origin** of the aggregate, even if this root is far below the actual played pitches.  This implies that there will often by integer pitch values that are < 0

The **Harmonic Root** represents the fundamental pitch or frequency from which a given set of notes derives its harmonic structure. It corresponds to the lowest frequency that aligns with all notes in a pitch set through the natural harmonic series. This root provides a foundation for understanding harmonic alignment, consonance, and dissonance within a tonal context.

---

### **Formula**

The harmonic root is determined through one of the following methods, depending on the input representation:

1. **Frequency-Based Harmonic Root**:
   $h\_i = \frac{f\_i}{f\_{\text{root}}}$  
   where $f\_i$ is the frequency of the note, $f\_{\text{root}}$ is the candidate root frequency, and $h\_i$ should ideally be an integer.

2. **Pitch-Based Harmonic Root**:
   $h\_i = \frac{p\_i - p\_{\text{root}}}{12}$  
   where $p\_i$ is the pitch (in semitones), $p\_{\text{root}}$ is the candidate root, and $h\_i$ should be an integer.

3. **Quantum-Enhanced Harmonic Root**:
   The quantum method encodes potential roots into a superposition state and evaluates harmonic alignment using quantum gates and optimization algorithms, such as the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).

---

#### **Frequency-Based Harmonic Root**

The frequency-based approach identifies the harmonic root by directly analyzing the frequencies of the given pitch set. It tests whether each frequency in the set aligns with the harmonic series of a candidate root frequency.

---

**Methodology**

1. **Input**:
   - A set of frequencies $S = \{f\_1, f\_2, \dots, f\_n\}$, where $f\_i$ represents the frequency of each pitch.

2. **Candidate Root Selection**:
   - Start with the lowest frequency $f\_{\text{min}}$ in $S$ as the initial candidate root $f\_{\text{root}}$.
   - Additional candidate roots are typically divisors of $f\_{\text{min}}$.

3. **Harmonic Alignment**:
   - For each candidate root $f\_{\text{root}}$, calculate:
     $$
     h\_i = \frac{f\_i}{f\_{\text{root}}}
     $$
   - If $h\_i$ is an integer for all $f\_i$, the candidate root is valid.

4. **Output**:
   - Return the **highest valid root** $f\_{\text{root}}$ that aligns with the harmonic series.

---

**Advantages**
- Direct and computationally simple for small datasets.
- Effective for well-tuned, equal-temperament frequencies.

**Challenges**
- Sensitive to small tuning deviations or noise in frequency data.
- Less effective for microtonal or non-Western systems.

---

**Example**
- **Input Frequencies**: $S = \{440, 660, 880\}$.
- **Candidate Root**: Start with $f\_{\text{root}} = 220 \, \text{Hz}$.
- **Harmonic Alignment**: 
  - $h = \{2, 3, 4\}$, all integers.
- **Result**: $f\_{\text{root}} = 220 \, \text{Hz}$.

---

#### **Pitch-Based Harmonic Root**

The pitch-based approach identifies the harmonic root by iteratively calculating the greatest common root (GCR) from pairs of pitches. This process allows for the identification of a root that aligns harmonically with the entire set of pitches.

---

**Methodology**

1. **Input**:
   - A set of pitches $P = \{p\_1, p\_2, \dots, p\_n\}$, where $p\_i$ is the semitone index of each pitch (e.g., $C4 = 60$).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Collapse Unisons and Octaves**:
     - Remove duplicate pitches in different octaves by reducing them to the same pitch class modulo 12.
     - Retain a count of how many times each pitch or pitch class occurs for future tonal weighting considerations.

3. **Iterative GCR Calculation**:
   - **Step 1**: Start with the lowest two pitches $p\_1$ and $p\_2$ (after preprocessing).
     - Calculate their GCR by identifying the lowest pitch that aligns as a common harmonic root:
       $$
       p\_{\text{root,1}} = \text{GCR}(p\_1, p\_2)
       $$
   - **Step 2**: Compare the candidate root $p\_{\text{root,1}}$ with the next pitch in the set:
       $$
       p\_{\text{root,2}} = \text{GCR}(p\_{\text{root,1}}, p\_3)
       $$
   - Repeat this process iteratively for all remaining pitches in the set.

4. **Output**:
   - Return the final root $p\_{\text{root,final}}$ after all pitches have been evaluated.

---

**Advantages**
- Efficiently narrows down the harmonic root using pairwise comparisons.
- Preserves octave and tonal relationships during preprocessing.
- Naturally incorporates tonal weights in future iterations by tracking duplicate pitch counts.

**Challenges**
- Assumes tonal alignment and may struggle with dissonant or atonal pitch sets.
- Sensitive to errors in initial pitch set preprocessing.

---

**Example**

1. **Input Pitches**: $P = \{C4, E4, G4, G5\}$ ($60, 64, 67, 79$).
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Collapse octaves: $P = \{C4, E4, G4\}$.
   - Retain weights: $\{C4: 1, E4: 1, G4: 2\}$.
3. **Iterative GCR Calculation**:
   - **Step 1**: Compare $C4$ ($60$) and $E4$ ($64$):
       $$
       p\_{\text{root,1}} = C2 \, (36)
       $$
   - **Step 2**: Compare $p\_{\text{root,1}} = C2$ ($36$) with $G4$ ($67$):
       $$
       p\_{\text{root,2}} = C2 \, (36)
       $$
   - Final root: $p\_{\text{root,final}} = C2$.

---

**Musical Context**
This approach emphasizes the alignment of pitch collections with a single harmonic root, making it well-suited for tonal and modal analysis. The iterative GCR method reflects how chords and harmonies are often perceived and analyzed in traditional music theory.


**Advantages**
- Works directly with pitch representations, avoiding the need for frequency conversion.
- Suitable for tonal music with equal-temperament pitches.

**Challenges**
- Assumes equal temperament and may be less accurate for non-Western or microtonal systems.
- Sensitive to rounding errors when pitches are approximated.

---

**Example**
- **Input Pitches**: $P = \{C4, E4, G4\}$ ($60, 64, 67$).
- **Candidate Root**: Start with $p\_{\text{root}} = C2$ ($36$).
- **Harmonic Alignment**: 
  - $h = \{4, 5, 6\}$, all integers.
- **Result**: $p\_{\text{root}} = C2$.

---

#### **Quantum-Enhanced Harmonic Root**

The quantum approach utilizes quantum computing principles, leveraging the properties of superposition and entanglement for parallel evaluation of harmonic roots.

---

**Methodology**

1. **Input Representation**:
   - Encode the input set into quantum states:
     - Frequencies: $\lvert S \rangle = \lvert f\_1 \rangle + \lvert f\_2 \rangle + \cdots + \lvert f\_n \rangle$.
     - Pitches: $\lvert P \rangle = \lvert p\_1 \rangle + \lvert p\_2 \rangle + \cdots + \lvert p\_n \rangle$.

2. **Candidate Root Superposition**:
   - Encode all possible roots $\lvert R \rangle = \lvert r\_1 \rangle + \lvert r\_2 \rangle + \cdots + \lvert r\_k \rangle$ into a quantum superposition.

3. **Harmonic Alignment**:
   - Apply quantum gates to calculate alignment:
     $$
     h\_i = \frac{f\_i}{f\_{\text{root}}} \quad \text{or} \quad h\_i = \frac{p\_i - p\_{\text{root}}}{12}
     $$
   - The gate evaluates whether $h\_i$ is an integer for each $f\_i$ or $p\_i$.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use quantum algorithms like the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for harmonic decomposition and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to refine results.

5. **Measurement**:
   - Collapse the quantum state to the most likely harmonic root:
     $$
     \lvert \Psi \rangle = \lvert r\_{\text{best}} \rangle
     $$

---

**Advantages**
- **Parallel Evaluation**: Allows testing of all possible roots simultaneously.
- **Precision**: Effective for complex, large, or microtonal datasets.
- **Adaptable**: Works with various tonal systems.

**Challenges**
- Requires quantum hardware or simulators.
- Susceptible to noise and errors in quantum systems.

---

**Example**
1. **Input Frequencies**: $S = \{440, 660, 880\}$.
2. **Superposition of Roots**: $\lvert R \rangle = \lvert 220 \rangle + \lvert 110 \rangle + \cdots$.
3. **Evaluation**: Gates test harmonic alignment of $\lvert S \rangle$ with $\lvert R \rangle$.
4. **Optimization**: QFT and QAOA refine the result.
5. **Output**: Collapsed state $\lvert r\_{\text{best}} \rangle = \lvert 220 \rangle$.
---

### **Calculation Examples**

#### **Example 1: Frequency-Based Harmonic Root**
- **Input Frequencies**: $S = \{440, 660, 880\}$
